npm run build # to build the static files
node build/index.js # to start the server after building
```

You can see the live server at http://localhost:3000 it should be running and returns `Welcome to Image processing api current version vX.X.X`.

### Endpoints

`/image_processing` it expects query inputs `name` "image name" and `width` and `height`.

There are validations for unprocessable entities.

Example of hitting this endpoint
`/image_processing?name=fjord.jpg&width=300&height=300`

expected output: to be a jpg image just like [src/images/fjord.jpg](./src/images/fjord.jpg) with a width of 300 and height of 300.

npm start # to start the live server via typescript
npm run build # build project in build/ directory
